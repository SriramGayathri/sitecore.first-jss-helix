        On this safari, you will see members of the family Ursidae, commonly known as bears. These omnivorous creatures are found almost exclusively in the Northern Hemisphere.
        
        In cold climates, bears do not hibernate but sleep most of the winter; their metabolism remains normal, and they may wake and emerge during warm spells.
        
        North American brown bears include the Kodiak bear and the grizzly. The Kodiak, the largest bear, sometimes stands 9 ft (2.7 m) high and weighs over 1,600 lb (730 kg). The grizzly, characterized by silver-tipped (grizzled) fur, is more highly carnivorous than most bears and preys on large mammals such as deer.
        
        The large, white polar bear is an arctic species. A solitary, fearless hunter, it is a powerful swimmer and feeds mostly on marine animals.
