In the zoo the animals are kept in separate enclosures, and their natural habitats are re-created. It is not possible, however, to house all wild animals from around the world in a zoo.
        
        The animals that are kept in a zoo are fed and provided water to drink. The animals are also kept clean, and are maintained in clean surroundings. There are trained caretakers who take care of the animals. If an animal falls sick or develops a disease, veterinarians help to treat and cure them.
        
        Visitors are permitted to go around and see the animals in a zoo. The animals should not be disturbed or teased by the visitors. The animals should also not be fed.
